A data frame with 50 observations on the following 6 variables.

``urbanpop``
   a numeric vector for the number of residents (per thousand) living in
   urban areas in 1970

Details
~~~~~~~

I copied these data from the ``robustbase`` package. I just didn't want
to make my students install it. Note: I'm pretty sure "NB" was suppose
to be "NE" and that "DY" is supposed to be "KY". I made those changes.
