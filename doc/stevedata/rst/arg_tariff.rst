Data come from various sources. World Bank estimates are used for
1980-1984 and 2010-2018, but see also Lora's (2012) report for the
Inter-American Development Bank. The 1980-1984 estimates are actually
means for 1980-1 and 1982-4 via Laird and Nogues' (1989) article in the
World Bank Economic Review.
