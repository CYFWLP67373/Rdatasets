Anscombe's (1973) Quartets
--------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

These are four x-y data sets, combined into a long format, which have
the same traditional statistical properties (mean, variance,
correlation, regression line, etc.). However, they look quite different.

Usage
~~~~~

::

   quartets

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 44 observations on the following 3 variables.

``group``
   a categorical identifier for the quartet

``x``
   a continuous variable

``y``
   a continuous variable

Details
~~~~~~~

Data come default in R, but I elected to change the format to be a bit
more accessible.
