Steve's (Professional) Clothes, as of March 3, 2019
---------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

I cobbled together this data set of the professional clothes (polos,
long-sleeve dress shirts, pants) in my closet, largely for illustration
on the origins of apparel in the U.S. for an intro lecture on trade.

Usage
~~~~~

::

   steves_clothes

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 79 observations on the following 4 variables.

``type``
   Type of clothing

``brand``
   The brand of clothing (e.g. Apt. 9, Saddlebred)

``color``
   the color (and/or pattern) of the article of clothing

``origin``
   The country that produced the garment.

Details
~~~~~~~

If you must know, I do most of my clothes shopping at major retailers in
the U.S. (mostly Belk, J.C. Penney, and Kohl's). If that's you as well,
the odds are good the distribution of my clothes will closely resemble
yours.)
