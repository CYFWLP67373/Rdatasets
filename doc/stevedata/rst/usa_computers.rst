Percentage of U.S. Households with Computer Access, by Year
-----------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

percentage of U.S. households with access to a computer, by year.

Usage
~~~~~

::

   usa_computers

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 19 observations on the following 2 variables.

``year``
   the year

``value``
   the estimated percentage of households with access to a computer

Details
~~~~~~~

Data are spotty and regrettably this is not a perfect time-series.
However, it is useful for an in-class exercise to show that the
proliferation of household computers (over time) in the United States
comes in part because of globalization. Use it for that purpose. The
data are reasonably faithful, but don't treat it as gospel. Exact
sourcing available upon request.
